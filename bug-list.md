# bug list

Every bug of consequence, and the test that stops it coming back. No entry without a test.

| n | bug | how it showed up | guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The microphone consumer read 0.6s per pass while a pass cost more than that, so it fell behind real time forever. | "it doesn't pick up what I say" | rewritten with a reader thread, `the_ring_never_grows_past_its_window` |
| 2 | Silence was measured as peak against a fixed floor, and one key press puts peak at 0.24 in a quiet room, so a recording never ended early. | Carl woke and then never answered | `one_click_fools_peak_and_does_not_fool_rms` |
| 3 | Carl heard his own voice through the speakers and answered his own answer. | replies to himself | echo cancellation, and `Devices` falling back to muting |
| 4 | `say` wrote the whole text into piper before starting the player, so a long answer deadlocked both. | never fired, found by reading | the player starts before any text is written |
| 5 | Slack was sent a JSON body for `users.info`, which only reads form parameters, so the id was dropped and Slack reported `user_not_found`. | Carl could not work out anybody's name | `user_not_found_mentions_the_encoding_trap` |
| 6 | A bare name in a channel produced an empty question, which the CLI refuses. | Carl posted a raw CLI error into a channel, twice | `an_empty_question_is_refused_here_rather_than_by_the_cli` |
| 7 | Two echo cancellers ran at once, so naming a device picked an unpredictable half of an unpredictable pair and nothing was cancelled. | Carl answered himself in a loop while reporting echo cancelled audio | `two_cancellers_are_refused_rather_than_gambled_on` |

| 8 | Overhaul mod families were matched with spaces removed from the mod name but not from the pattern, so any pattern containing a space could never match. | Space Exploration was installed and silently never reported | `no_overhaul_stem_can_be_impossible_to_match` |

## bug 7, in full

The one worth reading, because every check said the audio was fine.

A canceller was started by hand early on, and later the same canceller was started again as a
systemd service. Both create a sink called `carl-speaker` and a source called `carl-mic`.

Naming a device by name then picks whichever the audio server feels like, and there is no
reason for the two choices to belong to the same canceller. Carl played into one and recorded
from the other. The one listening had no idea what the one playing was doing, so it
subtracted nothing, and Carl heard himself at full volume.

What made it hard to see is that every diagnostic said the right thing. `Devices::detect`
found a sink called `carl-speaker` and a source called `carl-mic`, exactly as it was written
to, and reported echo cancelled audio. The service was active. The nodes existed. The audio
was not cancelled.

It looked like this in the journal, each reply becoming the next question:

```
08:14:52  Carl says:  Good, thanks.
08:14:54  Carl hears: "Good, thanks."
08:14:59  Carl says:  Glad to hear it.
08:15:01  Carl hears: "Glad to hear it."
08:15:08  Carl says:  Are we doing echoes now?
```

The fix is to count rather than to look. Exactly one of each is the cancelled case. Zero is
refused, which it already was, and now two or more is refused as well, with a message naming
the spare process. Falling back to muting the microphone is worse audio and obviously correct
behaviour, which beats better audio that silently is not.

This is the third time the same shape has appeared in this project, after the microphone
hearing the speakers and Carl reading his own Slack messages. It is the first time it got
through a guard that was written specifically for it.
